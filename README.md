# Term-Deposit-Prediction-Using-Python

## Problem Statement
Our client is a retail banking institution. Term deposits are a major source of income for a bank.

A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution. Our money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term.

The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing and digital marketing.
Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call centre’s are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence, it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call.

We are provided with the client data such as : age of the client, their job type, their marital status, etc. Along with the client data, we are also provided with the information of the call such as the duration of the call, day and month of the call, etc.

Given this information, we will predict if the client will subscribe to term deposit.

## Data
Following files are:
1. train.csv : We will use this dataset to train the model. This file contains all the client and call details as well as the target variable “subscribed”.
2. test.csv : We will use the trained model to predict whether a new set of clients will subscribe the term deposit.
